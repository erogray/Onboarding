## Project Manager Training

### New PM Instructions
* New PMs should shadow other PMs calls, meetings, scrums, retrospectives, sprint demos, kick-offs, etc.  
* New PMs to know how to react if someone calls on them unexpectedly, and how to quickly move along the meeting and get it back on track. The new PM should have a quick checkin like _"No project checkin. Here observing. Balance 8. I'll pass to Steve"_
* New PM can practice taking meeting notes so they can compare their own notes from a meeting to the notes the PM actually shares with the team & client. 

###Current PM Instructions
* All current PMs to look at their schedules and send invites to new PMs
* Current PMs to explain expectations of new PM roles on shadowing calls
* Current PMs to explain to team the role of the new PM on the calls (generally just observing and shouldn't be called upon unless they are actually part of that project)
* Current PMs to supply note templates should they exist (_ie scrum note template_)
