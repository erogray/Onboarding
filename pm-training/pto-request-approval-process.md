# PTO Request and Approval Process

A team member needs PTO... Here is the PMs role in this process: 

* The team member should ask their PM if it's ok with the project schedule for them to take PTO. 
* The PM will compare the PTO request to the project schedule and make the decision (_Note rarely is PTO declined_)
* The PM and the team member will decide how their PTO impacts the project and discuss coverage if needed and who can do it (_ie who picks up their ticket work if needed?_)
* After the PM approves the PTO, the team member will go through the formal request off process 
* A delivery manager will approve the PTO via email reply, and they will request that Judy add it to the Master Calendar
* The PM will enter the PTO into Resource Guru
* Judy will update the Master Calendar with their PTO
* As the date approaching, the PM & team member work through project impacts and coverage together
* The PM & team member should be providing the rest of the team with a heads-up of the PTO as it approaches
