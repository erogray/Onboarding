###<a name="pm-scrummaster"></a>The difference between PM and ScrumMaster roles

At CivicActions the PM and the ScrumMaster are the same (although it is conceivable that we would ask a non-PM to be a ScrumMaster).

There are aspects of the ScrumMaster role that relieve some traditional PM responsibilities. For example, on a scrum team, the team should be self-managing. Less impetus is put on the PM to manage team members, however we still ask the PM to recognize risk, velocity, and big picture management. The PM also manages budgets, plans for resourcing, and handles top level communications. The PM however is not a gatekeeper and the scrum team has access to all client communications, documents and a direct relationship with the PO.
