# Offboarding a Contractor from a Project

* If the person is a contractor, the PM should prepare on "Offboard Card" for after their work is completed to ensure they are properly removed from CivicActions tools, files and project. 
* An offboard card template is here: [https://trello.com/c/sXpzezNI/60-offboard-template](https://trello.com/c/sXpzezNI/60-offboard-template) //Is this supposed to stay?
* You should prepare this card at time of hire so that you have a place to track all tools that they get added 
* Specifically the PM will need to remove the contractor from all Google Docs they were added to, as well as Trello boards and any tools like Slack, Jira, MyBalsamiq, etc.
* The PM should remove the person from any calendar invites
* The PM should coordinate the Offboarding ticket with an engineer on the [IT/IS board](https://trello.com/b/zgRgVkvs/it-is-infrastructure-support-services) to ensure the remainder of the tasks are completed
* Hold an exit interview with the contractor & send a follow up email with the notes from the interview
