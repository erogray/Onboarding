### Basics
* We use Slack for chatting with the team -- whether as a whole, in smaller groups, or one on one.
* Ensure your status is set to "available" in Slack when online and free to chat, and "away" when not.
* Consider getting the Slack desktop app - either the native OS X / Windows one, or the Chrome app, which you can set up to run as a standalone app on system start up.

### Channels
* Slack organizes communication into **channels**. A channel can be public, so that everyone can join, or private, so that messages are shared with only select individuals. Most project channels are private by default.
* We default to open, so when in doubt, message the group in a public channel instead of a direct message, or one-on-one.
* There are a wide variety of different channels you can join, from work-related to topic-related.
* Mandatory channels include: General, Announcements, Engineering or PM, your Pod, your project channels
* Recommended channels: Random, SOTD, QOTD, Onboarding
* Announcements channel is for **announcements only**. All replies or conversation regarding announcements can transpire in the General channel. Keeping announcements chatter to a minimum ensures that anyone who hasn't been paying attention to the General or other channels will be able to quickly locate important or not-to-be-missed information. https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/announcements/details/
* An Onboarding channel exists which you can use for any general onboarding questions if needed: https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/onboarding/

### Notifications
* To notify someone in particular, type **@name** with your message.
* If you want to call attention to everyone subscribed to channel, write **@channel** or **@group**.
* To alert only those in a channel/group who are online, write **@here**.

### Tips
* Consider using the word "ping" to check on the availability of someone
* Wrap your text in single *asterisks* for bold, _underscores_ for italics, `grave accents` for code, and start the line with a > sign to make it a block quote. Formatting in Slack is similar to Markdown.
* To wrap single line output, use one pair of backticks ( `Your code here`). For multiple lines, wrap with three backticks (```Your code here. Some more code.```).
* Create a Google Hangout from Slack: type **/hangout** (will need to authorize the slack app in hangout too)
* To quickly bring back the last message you sent back to the text box, just press the Up arrow key.

#### Lists

##### Internal

 * ca-team for all team wide communication, and important announcements (slack #announcements used often too)
 * ca-employees is generally low traffic and used for HR notices, etc
 * ca-[functionalgroup] -hydra, -orion -sales, -dev, -team
 * Every project has it's own list - a way to overhear each other

##### Client lists

Example: 

 * teach@lists.civicactions.net  (includes clients)
 * teach-int@lists.civicactions.net (just for CivicActions staff)

#### Protocol

To get someone's attention, put their name in all caps in subject. Or use "ALL" to get everyone's attention. 

Example: 

* Subject: "RICHARD: are you around this afternoon?"
* Subject: "ALL: please update your hours by EOD"
* Subject: "URGENT: please update your hours by EOD"

#### Email Filters

* Consider using filters to help manage you mail in preparation for quick archive

### <a name="google-calendar"></a>Google Calendar

### Best Practices
* Set your time zone
* Set your working hours (& keep it current)
* Set your location
* Always send invitations to first.last@civicactions.com
* Make sure your main first.last@civicactions.com calendar is at sharing at least free/busy with everyone in CivicActions.
* Consider enabling "speedy meetings"
* Reply to meeting invitations (yes, no, maybe)
* Use the "optional" feature for attendees who are not required to attend
* Use the "Find a Time" feature to identify a meeting time where all required participants are free. 
* Complete the Event Details section
* If your event is related to a ticket, then include the ticket reference in the event title (i.e. a Jira RD-19 ticket event could be "Prototype Meeting RD-19")
* Can create the hangouts from these events
* Consider Labs: Gentle Notifications
* Add the "CivicActions: Out of Office" calendar

### <a name="google-hangouts"></a>Google Hangouts
#### Best Practices
* Be on time - please! Every 10 seconds actually matters
* We use the chat and screensharing features often
* Turn off camera or reduce bandwidth if connection is poor
* Use the mute button so mute is transparent to all (vs headphone muting)
* Use some kind of headset or headphones instead of relying solely on computer mic (computer mics can sometimes create echoes)
* Can also use the hangout to call people in via phone
* We can invite people outside of CivicActions too
* Add a photo to your account so it shows up in Hangout
* Proper etiquette for hangout professionalism (background visual & noise, attire/dress, using effects, eating, muting etc)
* It's ok to mute other each other 

#### Available Commands

## <a name="telephone-use"></a>Telephone Use
* There are times when a phone call in may also be necessary, such as when wifi is not available or to call in to BlueJeans
* Don't rely on speaker feature, but have a headset handy
* You may need to be called into a Google Hangout if you can't attend the video meeting
* Sharing your phone number with the client/PO is optional
