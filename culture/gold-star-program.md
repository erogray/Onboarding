# Gold Star Program

"Gold Stars" are small acts of recognition and acknowledgment for being outstanding in some way. When someone does something "over and above" or deserves some recognition in some other way, give them a "Gold Star" by slacking a note to the team explaining what the commendation is for.

How to give a gold star:

* Send a slack message in #gold-star to the team with and the persons name and tell the awesome story. What did this person do? Why are you inspired to give them props?

It's that easy. Admin contact the recipient and offer a choice of an Amazon gift card or a contribution in their name to a charity of their choosing to the recipient and ensure that they receive it.

We trust the CivicActions team to not abuse this by giving hundreds to each other and to use it for the purpose it was intended: to be an easy way to acknowledge someone who did something special.
